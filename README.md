# VirtualOrderedFields
(Lua 5.4): Virtual ordered fields for tables. Retains support for numeric indices, and unordered fields in the same table. This won't modify your fields at all, because it only keeps track of what keys are inserted at what times when you tell it to.

# Documentation
Read the source code, sorry. I've added some comments. I made this as a completely personal package and released it in case someone else may need it.

# Reliability
Not stress tested all that well, written in 15 minutes. I tested the features, they worked. Hopefully some others find use. Feel free to report any problems though.
